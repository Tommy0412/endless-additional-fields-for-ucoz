# Endless additional fields for ucoz

This is designed for free ucoz accounts. It allows you to add an infinite number of additional fields (ucoz provides up to 6 fields in your free account).

In this code, the fields are set up under the theme of "online movies", but you can change the fields for any other projects.

file " addedit-online.js" attach template "Page add/edit material" <br>
file " full-online.js" attach template "Page of the material and comment on it"

When you add or edit the material, all the information that is entered in the fields are added to the field "full description".

"`
The only limitation of this lie is the limited number of characters in the full description given by ucoz
"`
